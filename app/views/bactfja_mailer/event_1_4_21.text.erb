Judge Vanessa Baraitser, who is presiding over Julian Assange’s extradition hearings, has acknowledged the political
nature of Assange’s hearings and has decided to not rule until at least after the U.S. Presidential election on
November 3rd.

Written closing statement by the defense is due on October 30th, and a written closing statement by the prosecution is
due on November 13th.

This decision will have lasting impacts on journalism in the United States and globally.

Join us, along with #Candles4Assange events world wide, as we come together in support of Julian Assange.

Please bring signs/banners/fliers if you have them, but mainly just show up. Safe distancing & masks please.
