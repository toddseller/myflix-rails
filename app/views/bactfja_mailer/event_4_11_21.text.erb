GLOBAL DAY OF PROTEST!
On Feb. 12, 2021, the Biden administration filed grounds for appeal against the
UK judge’s decision to block the U.S. extradition request for Julian Assange. On
Jan. 4, 2021, the UK judge had ruled against extradition of Julian due to his
suicide risk if extradited. She noted how the US prison system is not suitable
for a person with Julian’s mental health needs (depression & Autism Spectrum
Disorder.) Sadly this judge agreed with all other (bullshit) arguments presented
against Assange. The ruling was a victory for Julian, yet damaging to him and
our freedom of press.

Julian’s Defense had until March 29th to submit a response, which it did. Now
the high court must decide whether or not to hear the U.S. case. If the high
court allows for the appeal, the case should be heard within a few months, if the
high court rejects the US grounds for appeal, Julian will be freed. If the
appeals case is heard, the losing party can appeal AGAIN to the Supreme Court
and/or the European Court of Human Rights. That process can take several years.
As of now, there are no court dates set.

This from a brilliant update by the lovely & skilled Taylor Hudak with full story
not to be missed here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLsX0TSHlz8.

Stella Moris, Julian’s fiance & mother of their two children, says it is possible
the appeal could be heard in May if the court grants the appeal. But there are no
set dates.

More updates from Stella, and to contribute to Julian's defense, can be found
