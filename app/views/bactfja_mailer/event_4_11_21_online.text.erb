THE GREEN PARTY OF ALAMEDA COUNTY PRESENTS:
GREEN SUNDAY: JULIAN ASSANGE AND PRESS FREEDOM, WITH STEVE ZELTZER AND KIM WHITE
Capitalism and US imperialism are faced with a crisis of legitimacy brought about
by first amendment rights given to the Press. Journalists are protected from
control by laws passed by Congress. However, private control of the press has
allowed corporations and the capitalist class to maintain gatekeeper status for
most information, news and propaganda. The internet changed that by opening a
door to information and publications not controlled by the power establishment.
Organizations like Wikileaks were free to reveal the brutality, corruption and
hypocrisy of Western governments and corporate pillaging. In response, the US and
its allies are attempting to control journalism by defining a “journalist class”
so they can delegitimize journalists and any news outlet outside their control.
Although Assange has been a member of the Australian MEAA journalist union since
2011, western governments and corporate media are attempting to characterize him
as “illegitimate” and therefore not covered by first amendment rights, opening
him to charges under the 1918 Espionage Act. This attack on Assange is designed
to create fear within journalism and to set a precedent that state power to
control information is global. The ruthless and illegal prosecution and
imprisonment of Assange is not only about the vicious repression of an individual
who defied western imperialism. These events reveal western governments’
desperate collusion to undermine all Press Freedom in an attempt to maintain the
capitalist power structure.

For the April Green Sunday, Steve Zeltzer will discuss the role of Assange as a
journalist, the attack on journalists and journalism by the capitalist class and
the role of the media worker union and labor in general in taking up the case of
Julian Assange. Kim White will provide an introduction to the Wikileaks archives
so people will gain an understanding of what is contained within the archives
with the goal of providing them with the tools to conduct their own searches.
