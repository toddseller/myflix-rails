LaborFest Forum
Journalists and whistleblowers are under attack, from Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning to freelance journalist Bryan
Carmody in San Francisco. When the president of the United States calls journalists “scum” and encourages his supporters
to verbally and physically threaten journalists, the right of all journalists to do their work is threatened.
