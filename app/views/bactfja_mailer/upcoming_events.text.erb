Upcoming Events:

JULIAN’S 50TH GLOBAL DAY OF PROTEST!
Julian Assange has been detained in the UK since he was 39 years old. Threatened
with 175 years in prison by the US Government, Julian has spent the past 2 years
incarcerated in Belmarsh Prison on trumped up charges.

Join us, during #AssangeWeek (June 26 – July 4), in a Global Day of Protest on
Julian’s 50th birthday as we continue to raise awareness of his plight and call
on the US Government to drop the charges against him.

On the heels of their recent visit to Oakland, Julian’s father and brother, John
and Gabriel Shipton, will have just concluded their #HomeRun4Julian tour of the
US. Their mission was to raise awareness of the importance of protecting
whistleblowers and journalists, and to advocate for the release of Julian Assange.
Whom the United Nations has declared “arbitrarily detained” since 2010. Pictures
and videos of their events can be found here. https://assangedefense.org/tour/

Please call the Department of Justice, (202) 353-1555, and leave a comment asking
to DROP THE CHARGES against an innocent journalist for exposing US WAR CRIMES the
public deserved to know about! This US persecution sets a dangerous precedent
globally to journalism.

Please bring signs if you can – mainly just join us! We will serve cake!

As always, we encourage masks and social distancing in general.

Corporate Media Independent Media & Investigative Journalism
The monopolization of the media and the effect of corporate control of social
media is a growing threat to freedom. This panel will look at how independent
media is fighting to cover stories that corporate media in San Francisco and the
US have covered up. This includes the privatization of public resources, the
contamination of workers and the community at Hunters Point/Treasure Island and
the attacks on journalists and their rights in San Francisco and around the world
including Julian Assange.

Featured Panelists:

 • Tim Redmond, 48 Hills
 • Malik Washington, San Francisco Bay View
 • Steve Zeltzer, WorkWeek KPOO

Sponsored by 48 Hills, WorkWeek & SF Bay View
