JULIAN’S 50TH GLOBAL DAY OF PROTEST!
Julian Assange has been detained in the UK since he was 39 years old. Threatened
with 175 years in prison by the US Government, Julian has spent the past 2 years
incarcerated in Belmarsh Prison on trumped up charges.

Join us in a Global Day of Protest on Julian’s 50th birthday as we continue to
raise awareness of his plight and call on the US Government to drop the charges
against him.

As always, we encourage masks and social distancing.
