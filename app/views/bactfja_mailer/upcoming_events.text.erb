A Napa Institute for Peace and Jason Kishineff Event

The main witness against Assange was a pedophile that was a diagnosed sociopath
who admitted he lied in order to make a deal with the FBI. He has since been
arrested again and is unlikely to be able to testify. Nonetheless the US refuses
to drop the charges and is dragging out its persecution of Assange for as long
as possible, to make an example of him. They hope he dies in jail.

Julian Assange's extradition trial begins October 27 in the UK. Join us on the
25th and 26th as we stand beside the highway outside Napa College during rush
hour traffic, with signs about Julian's unfair prosecution, to raise awareness.

Organized by @kishineff and @napa_peace.

Defense will be posting several of these soon and providing information.
