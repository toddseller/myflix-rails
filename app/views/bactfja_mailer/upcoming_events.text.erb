Please see the DON'T EXTRADITE ASSANGE CAMPAIGN https://dontextraditeassange.com as well as https://defend.wikileaks.org
for facts.

We the People stand against the DIRECT THREAT to Julian Assange’s life as well as our FreePress/FreeSpeech by oligarchy
INTIMIDATION, SILENCING and PERSECUTION of journalists and citizens, and WAR distraction! WE ARE FIGHTING FOR OUR VERY
DEMOCRACY ON TRIAL along with the life of multi-award-winning journalist, publisher and Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange.
Truth-tellers Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning sit jailed for revealing WAR CRIMES (https://youtu.be/5rXPrfnU3G0) that
have never been prosecuted to this day!

Julian Assange faces charges of 175 years in jail based on a farce 1917 Espionage Act. He WILL NOT GET A FAIR TRIAL if
extradited to the U.S. “No national security defendant has ever won a case in the EDVA [Eastern District of Virginia],”
Kiriakou told RT upon Assange’s arrest. “In my case, I asked Judge Brinkema to declassify 70 documents that I needed to
defend myself. She denied all 70 documents. And so I had literally no defense for myself and was forced to take a plea.”

“He will not, he cannot get a fair trial,” Kiriakou said on a Unity4J vigil when Assange was still at the embassy. “It’s
impossible, because the deck is stacked. And everybody knows what’s gonna happen if he comes back to the Eastern District
of Virginia. This is the same advice I gave Ed Snowden: don’t come home, because you can’t get a fair trial here. Julian
doesn’t have the choice, and that’s what frightens me even more.”

Assange is indeed being extradited to face trial in the Eastern District of Virginia. Manning herself did not get a fair
trial according to her lawyer. https://theindicter.com/debunking-all-the-assange-smears-2

We speak out for OUR RIGHT TO KNOW and against the PERSECUTION of all journalists, whistleblowers, and citizens standing
and punished for revealing and supporting TRUTH! This is not something you hear about on Main Stream Media (MSM) It is a
topic well-hidden, purposefully smeared, misreported, and blacked out. The MSM only reports the acceptable narrative.
Variations to the acceptable narrative are now punishable by jailing, torture and even death as the U.S. turns a blind
eye (Khashoggi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Jamal_Khashoggi). The U.S. feels it can extend its claw
of power to control foreign/any journalists anywhere in the world for any actions not compliant with its acceptable
narrative, as evidenced by the Julian Assange case.

The attack and arrest by the British government and police on Julian Assange with the direct support of the U.S.-controlled
($4.2 BILLION PAID in IMF) Ecuadoran government is an attack by the U.S. government on all journalists, whistleblowers,
and democracy. It is aimed at closing down all alternative media- any source not MSM. The news We the People hear shall
only be controlled by the government, says the government. Journalists and whistle-blowers and even citizens who support
them are now under attack: imprisoned; property seized without warrants, homes invaded and turned over- regularly- IN
THIS “FREE” COUNTRY!

WHO IS POSTING THIS:

This website, BayAction2FreeAssange.com, and mobilization are being coordinated by average citizens. Our power is in our
unity and that is what our evil overlords fear. We are people, as in - We the People- uniting the international working
class and anyone interested in PRESERVING HUMANITY. Attacks on the media by governments throughout the world have grown
exponentially over the years with journalists facing threats, torture, and even murder. The U.S. is no exception and IS
CULPRIT INSTIGATOR and CONTROLLER of this despicable activity.

We must engage and mobilize to join in the fight to protect press freedom, freedom of speech, and our democracy as it is
now truly being stripped away. The right of people to have information about their governments, and governments around
the world, is vital to protect the conditions and lives of people globally.
