Upcoming Events:

Please save the date and join us in solidarity with Assange Defense and CodePink
at the birthplace of the Free Speach Movement, Sproul Plaza. Speakers and
perfomances will be shared as they become available.

On the weekend before Julian Assange's October 27-28 High Court appeal in London,
Assange Defense will hold national events in solidarity with Global events as we
all stand in defense of Julian’s life and our collective fight for the freedom of
journalism.

The United States government is appealing the UK Magistrates Court January 4, 2021
ruling against Julian's extradition and 175 year jail sentence for publishing the
truth about US war crimes in Iraq & Afghanistan. All while the US government's
crimes against humanity, torture, and killings of innocent civilians and
journalists, in our names and with our tax dollars, goes unprosecuted.

Most appallingly, this farce continues despite the recent revelations that a key
witness for the US government, convicted felon Siggi Thordarson, admitted he
fabricated his testimony against Julian in exchange for a deal from the US. This
fact has been witheld from mainstream media along with other important truths.

Prominent figures are coming forward to question the US about one of the most
historic cases in our lifetime as published in Newsweek September 10, 2021.

Why Should I Care About Julian Assange?
Is a campaign to express and educate those who may not be informed about the big
picture of this case in a critical point of our history. Make your own 15 second
video - “Why should I care about Julian Assange?” - with your own sign. Assange
Defense will be posting several of these soon and providing information.

As always, we encourage masks and social distancing in general.
