ROGER WATERS: THIS IS NOT A DRILL VOLUTEER FLYERING ACTION

"Inspired by Jack Kerouac's On the Road and the Beat Generation of authors of the
1950s, who had flourished in the North Beach area of San Francisco, those who
gathered in Haight-Ashbury during 1967 allegedly rejected the conformist and
materialist values of modern life; there was an emphasis on sharing and community.
The Diggers established a Free Store, and Haight Ashbury Free Clinics was founded
on June 7, 1967, where medical treatment was provided."
– Wikipedia, Summer of Love https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_Love

This was the San Francisco of the 1960s. The epicenter of the anti-war,
anti-establishment movement. San Francisco showed the world what the power of the
disenfranchised could achieve.

However, this is not the San Francisco of today. Those flower children of the
1960s went on to help found Silicon Valley and the technology that would again
change the world. But now those disenfranchised have become the establishment
that they so vehemently rebelled against decades before.

This is the San Francisco where drones from Salesforce's Dreamforce convention
could not be bothered to hear about Julian Assange. This is the San Francisco
which supports free speech as long as it aligns with the established message.
This is the San Francisco that doesn’t allow pamphleting at the Chase Center
because it is private property all the way to the street. This is the San Francisco
that is owned and operated by corporations while still trying to hide behind a
veil of the past.

It is with sadness that we have to ask you not to come and volunteer tonight to
help support Julian. In respect to Roger Waters, his team, as well as
Assange Defense, we do not want to violate the venue's policy of pamphleting on
the Chase Center grounds. Roger Waters has graciously given us a platform within
the arena to reach out to all those that are interested in the plight of Julian
Assange and we do not want to do anything that may jepordize this relationship.
