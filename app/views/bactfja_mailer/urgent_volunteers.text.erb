URGENT: VOLUNTEERS NEEDED!

INFORMATION FOR THE ROGER WATERS: THIS IS NOT A DRILL VOLUTEER FLYERING ACTION
YOU are urgently needed to save Julian’s life and our Freedom of Press & Speech.
Time is running out. Roger Waters has generously created this opportunity to make
a crucial difference in our world- vital to our survival.

Volunteers are still needed in San Francisco to flyer outside the Chase Center
on September 23rd and 24th. Those who volunteer to flyer outside the venue will
need to purchase tickets if they also plan to see the concert.

We ask volunteers to meet us at the East Entrance, by the Seeing Spheres art
installation, on the corner of 16th Street and Terry A Francois Blvd at 4:30PM
and 10:00PM to receive the flyers.

There are two flyers we need to distribute before and after the concert. Although
we already have 100s of flyers printed, if you can print some to bring along and
pass out, it is much appreciated (the flyers can be downloaded here and here).
Plus, sharing these at other locations & events would be fabulous as well.

Ultimately, you just need to show up to get them and help! Activists at other
venues have handed out 1000s of flyers as they said to people, “Free Assange,
Don’t Let the War Mongers Win!”

Key Points:

Roger Waters hopes everyone will wear an activism tee shirt (We’ll be wearing
Free Assange tee shirts). No worries if you don’t have one, please just show up.

FOR THE PRESS OUR MESSAGE IS: “Freedom of Press is on Trial; not just Julian Assange”

If anyone asks/interviews any one of us - this is the KEY message - please refrain
from speaking about other opinions on other topics to the press. Don’t let our
message in this opportunity be contorted.

UPCOMING EVENTS

SF CHRONICLE: END YOUR SILENCE ON THE JAILING AND EXTRADITION OF JULIAN ASSANGE
Press Conference/Speak Out at SF Chronicle on September 22, 2022 12:00 Noon.

The continued incarceration and possible extradition of Australian journalist and
publisher Julian Assange is a threat not only to all journalists in the world but
publishers such as the SF Chronicle.

Using the Espionage Act, even though he is not a US citizen, the US government
is prosecuting the supposed crime of releasing documents that expose war crimes
and atrocities committed by the US war machine in Iraq.

Of course, the perpetrators of the US crimes in Iraq have never been prosecuted
but the whistleblower Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, is being prosecuted.

We must raise our voices to defend whistleblowers and independent journalists
being censored and persecuted for revealing the truth and reporting on issues
that people need to know.

Assange is a member of the Australian journalist's union MEAA member since 2007.
The Pacific Media Workers Guild, which represents journalists at the
San Francisco Chronicle, and the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ)
have also called for his freedom. Nearly all journalist unions throughout the
world are demanding his freedom.

We urge the San Francisco Chronicle and all news publishers both print and online
to join the call for his freedom.

IMPORTANT STANDING ACTIONS:

THINK GLOBALLY, ACT LOCALLY
More than ever, now is the time to lobby your City, County, and State politicians
to pass resolutions that call for the freedom of Julian Assange. Plus, contact
your Representatives and Senators in Congress and ask them to speak out in
defense of your right to free press and to oppose the extradition of Julian Assange.

#YELLOWRIBBONS4ASSANGE
Hang #YellowRibbons4Assange in your town and wherever you go.
#YellowRibbons4Assange is a vital campaign that Christine Assange &
@TRUMANHUMAN2020 started in May, 2020. It is an ongoing, easy, and meaningful
action to take anywhere. It spreads the awareness of Julian’s plight. It has
started many conversations at our home’s gate & at events to promote accurate
information in conversation.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
We must stand together and show the United States government that we will not
stand for their tyranny. If Julian is indeed extradited, we call for actions the
following day at Federal buildings and City Halls around the country. We must
make our voices heard so we can speak for the man they're trying to silence!
