S.F. Pride Parade – Generations of Resistance
The San Francisco LGBT Pride Parade and Celebration is one of the largest gatherings of LGBT people and allies in the nation.
The 49th annual parade kicks off on Sunday, June 30, 2019, at 10:30am at Embarcadero and ends at Civic Center in San Francisco.
The theme for 2019 is “Generations of Resistance.” Join us as we demonstrate and celebrate with over 250 parade contingents!
There is no fee to watch the Parade (except in the case of Grandstand Seating along the Parade route). We do request a $1.00 donation at the entry gates to the Celebration area.
