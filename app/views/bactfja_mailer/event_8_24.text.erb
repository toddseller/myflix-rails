Stand 4 Julian & Chelsea
Join our protest against Julian Assange’s U.S. Extradition and Chelsea Manning’s imprisonment. We’ll chant for their
freedom, distribute fliers and engage with the public over a two hour call to action, at the Powell & Market Cable Car
turnaround.
“The days when I could read and speak and organize to defend myself, my ideals, and my people are over until I am free!
Everyone else must take my place.” - Julian Assange, from Belmarsh Prison
