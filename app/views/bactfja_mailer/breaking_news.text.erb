JULIAN'S UK APPEAL DENIED!

On March 14, 2022, the UK Supreme Court refused to hear Julian’s case and sent
it to the office of UK Home Secretary Priti Patel to make the final extradition
decision.

Bogusly charged under The Espionage Act, if extradited Julian faces trial in
Alexandria, Virgina, a mere 15 miles from CIA headquarters. With the impossiblity
of an impartial jury, Julian faces 175 years in prison.

WHERE CAN I FOLLOW THE CASE?

Stella Morris, Julian's fiancé and mother of his two youngest sons, continually
updates Julian's campaign on crowdjustice.com where you can also donate to his
legal defense. Plus, you can now follow her substack.

Follow Mohamed Elmaazi on Twitter where he continues to tweet and speak about
Julian's case. Tweeting on March 14th, "Very frustrating decision by the UKSC.
But this isn't the end of the road. Once Westminster MC directs the case to the
Home Secretary, the defence will have 4 weeks to submit arguments for her to
reject extradition. Defence can also file appeals on grounds they originally lost
on."
