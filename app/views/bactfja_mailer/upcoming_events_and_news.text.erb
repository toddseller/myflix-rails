HOME RUN FOR JULIAN 2021 US TOUR SAN FRANCISCO & OAKLAND
We are thrilled to be supporting Assange Defense's #HomeRun4Julian 2021 US Tour.
John and Gabriel Shipton, Julian's father and brother, are set to tour the US to
advocate for the release of Julian starting in Miami for a live-streamed event
on June 6ᵗʰ. The Shiptons will be hitting 16 cities throughout June and aim to
raise awareness of the importances of protecting whistleblowers and journalists.
They end their tour in Washington, DC in hopes of pressuring the Biden
administration to drop its extradition efforts.

Exact times and locations for John and Gabriel's stops in San Francisco and
Oakland are pending, but we'll keep you up-to-date!

A Crime Against Humanity as per 1997 Rome Statute of the ICC.

FREE THE TRUTH: FREE ASSANGE DOCUMENTARY FILM PRE-PRODUCTION CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN
There have been many documentaries made about Assange that perpetuate false
narratives or focus on the drama and controversy of the events leading to him
seeking refuge at the Equadorian embassy and his subsequent arrest and current
incarceration.

This film will take a very different approach, and instead make a strong case in
support of his freedom, highlight the very significant precedent it sets for
investigative journalism and independent media, and how the outcome effects
every one of us.

You can learn more about this project and contribute on their GoFundMe page.

SEND A MESSAGE TO THE NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL!
There might still be the chance to convince the new Attorney General of Justice,
Merrick Garland, to drop the charges, which is also a current campaign goal. It
would be good to motivate as many people as possible to contact Mr. Garland.

Send a message to the new Attorney General today!
