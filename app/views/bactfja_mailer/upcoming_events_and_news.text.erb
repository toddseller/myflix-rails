ITHAKA: A FIGHT TO FREE JULIAN ASSANGE
A moving and intimate portrayal of one father’s fight to save his son, Ithaka
exposes the brutal realities of the campaign to free Julian Assange. The world’s
most famous political prisoner, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, has become an
emblem of an international arm wrestle over freedom of journalism, government
corruption and unpunished war crimes.

Now with Julian facing a 175-year sentence if extradited to the US, his family
members are confronting the prospect of losing Julian forever to the abyss of the
US justice system. This David-and-Goliath struggle is personal – and, with
Julian’s health declining in a British maximum-security prison, the clock is
ticking.

Now it’s up to Julian’s father, John Shipton, and fiancé (now wife) Stella Moris,
to join forces to advocate for Julian on this international odyssey. As they rally
a world-wide network of supporters and politicians, they cautiously step into the
media’s glare – and are forced to confront the events that made Julian a global
flashpoint.

Winner of Best Documentary and Best Direction at the 2022 Capricorn Film Festival
in Queensland. Gabriel Shipton’s new movie, Ithaka, will soon be launching in
the UK having premiered at the Sydney Film Festival in November 2021. There are
currently no planned showings in the US, but we will keep you posted as
information becomes available.

Even if you can’t join us for an event, take inspiration from Stella and stand
