UPDATE ON JULIAN'S CASE
– August 26, 2022

Julian Assange files his Perfected Grounds of Appeal before the High Court of
Justice Administrative Court. The Respondents are the Government of the United
States and the Secretary of State for the Home Department, Priti Patel.

The Perfected Grounds of Appeal concerning the United States Government include
the following points:

 - Julian Assange is being prosecuted and punished for his political opinions
   (s.81 (a) of the Extradition Act)
 - Julian Assange is being prosecuted for protected speech (Article 10)
 - The request itself violates the US-UK Extradition Treaty and International
   law because it is for political offenses
 - The US Government has misrepresented the core facts of the case to the British
   courts
 - The extradition request and its surrounding circumstances constitute an abuse
   of process

IMPORTANT STANDING ACTIONS:

THINK GLOBALLY, ACT LOCALLY
More than ever, now is the time to lobby your City, County, and State politicians
to pass resolutions that call for the freedom of Julian Assange. Plus, contact
your Representatives and Senators in Congress and ask them to speak out in
defense of your right to free press and to oppose the extradition of Julian Assange.

CALLING ALL UNION MEMBERS!
Let's stand united in support of Julian Assange. Get your local union and labor
councils to petition the California State Federation of Labor and the AFL-CIO to
call for the freedom of Assange and demand the US government to drop the charges.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
We must stand together and show the United States government that we will not
stand for their tyranny. If Julian is indeed extradited, we call for actions the
following day at Federal buildings and City Halls around the country. We must
make our voices heard so we can speak for the man they're trying to silence!
