SF CHRONICLE: END YOUR SILENCE ON THE JAILING AND EXTRADITION OF JULIAN ASSANGE
Press Conference/Speak Out at SF Chronicle on September 22, 2022 12:00 Noon.

The continued incarceration and possible extradition of Australian journalist and
publisher Julian Assange is a threat not only to all journalists in the world but
publishers such as the SF Chronicle.

Using the Espionage Act, even though he is not a US citizen, the US government is
prosecuting the supposed crime of releasing documents that expose war crimes and
atrocities committed by the US war machine in Iraq.

Of course the perpetrators of the US crimes in Iraq have never been proscuted but
the whistleblower Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, is being prosecuted.

We must raise our voices to defend whistleblowers and independent journalists
being censored and persecuted for revealing the truth and reporting on issues
that people need to know.

Assange is a member of the Australian journnalist’s union MEAA member since 2007.
The Pacific Media Workers Guild, which represents journalists at the San Francisco
Chronicle, and the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) have also calld
for his freedom. Nearly all journalist unions throughout the world are demanding
his freedom.

We urge the San Francisco Chronicle and all news publishers both print and online
to join the call for his freedom.
