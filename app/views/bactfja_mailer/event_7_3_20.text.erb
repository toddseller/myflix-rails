Global Birthday Vigil

We join the global #Candles4Assange vigil to honor Julian Assange as he spends another birthday separated from family and
friends - jailed and tortured in Belmarsh Prison, London. Now more than ever, and in the face of a global pandemic,
Julian needs our strength and solidarity to ensure that his unlawful imprisonment for publishing the truth does not
become a death sentence.

For those with medical conditions, or otherwise unable to attend, please join the stream by Action 4 Assange on their
YouTube Channel. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCasTaU6X3yCRyItNB83hnGg/featured

Please Remember Signs, Masks, and Social Distancing!
