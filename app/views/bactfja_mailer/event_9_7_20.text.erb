NOW IS A CRITICAL TIME TO STAND FOR JULIAN ASSANGE.
We hope everyone is intact & doing ok after all the fires & amidst pandemic times.
Sadly the show trial of Julian Assange marches on, and intensifies our need to act to save his life & our freedom of
speech & journalism worldwide. His extradition hearing starts on September 7, 2020 at the Old Bailey in London, and is
anticipated to last for three weeks.
We would like to show our solidarity with the global #Candles4Assange events in support of Julian. Please join us in a
virtual sharing collection of events by sharing photos of your live, virtual, solo or group events around the Bay Area
this month.
Please join us LIVE, if you can, and stand for Julian Assange in peaceful protest and educating the public with fliers
and information.
Please bring signs/banners/fliers if you have them, but mainly just show up. Safe distancing & masks please.
We realize that not everyone can attend live or in San Francisco. We’re glad support anyone having any sort of action.
NO ACTION IS TOO SMALL & ANYTHING POSITIVE/WELL-INTENTIONED HELPS!
Julian’s farce trial is set to go on for weeks- daily actions are helpful- any day/time.
Please let us know & we’ll be glad to post it on the website & promote it via adding your city to the global protests
list on @Candles4Assange, #Unity4J, and @action_4assange.  Or feel free to do so directly.
We hope to share/post as many photos as possible of ANY actions. Please send direct in reply or tag @JeaniRN on Twitter
& noting BayAction2FreeAssange if you want it added.

There are many ways to take actions & be a part of helping free Julian Assange:
You can find fliers on our resources page and SomersetBean.com has some brilliant graphic informational fliers you can
download or print directly.
#YellowRibbons4Assange is a vital campaign that Christine Assange & @TRUMANHUMAN2020 started in May, 2020. It is
ongoing, easy, & meaningful action to take anywhere. It spreads the awareness of Julian’s plight.  It has started many
conversations at our home’s gate & at events to promote accurate information in conversation. You can learn more here.
#Clovers4Assange by Anons / @YourMarkLubbers. Add a clover to your Twitter & elsewhere to promote awareness for Julian.

DONATIONS:
Julian’s partner & mother of their two children, @Stellamoris1, has started a fundraiser for legal fees. No contribution
is too small.
As Stella has expressed the importance of educating the public on Julian’s case, as has his mother, @MrsC_Assange,
noting how important it is to reach outside our immediate bubble. Many people don’t know about Julian’s case due to
media blackout or only know the smears promoted by mainstream media worldwide. It is up to each of us to spread the
truth to save his life.

PLEASE TUNE IN TO:
Action4Assange live broadcasts from D.C. from September 4th - 25th where they will protest and lead demonstrations to
