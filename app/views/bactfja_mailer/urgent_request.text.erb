IN SEARCH OF A CURRENT KPFA MEMBERS & BAY AREA ASSANGE ACTIVISTS

We are in search of a current* KPFA member and Bay Area Assange activist who can
run for the local station board in the current election.

Why run for the KPFA board?
KPFA is Northern California’s ONLY independent media outlet and your voice and
your vote are crucial. We need to raise awareness of Julian Assange’s case and
plight to the KPFA board and to our communities by using our local public radio
station. Thus promoting this action to the National network.

The current KPFA board opposed a motion to call for Julian Assange’s freedom.
Julian himself, from the depths of Belmarsh Prison, has outlined the importance
of action on local board and Union levels in previous communications to
supporters. In essence, we must act now.

If you can't run, PLEASE VOTE!
It is IMPORTANT that any Assange supporting KPFA members consider the current
bylaw changes proposed. These bylaws are being pushed by the same people who do
not support Julian Assange.

We must raise our voices to defend whistleblowers and independent journalists
being censored and persecuted for revealing the truth and reporting on issues
that people need to know.

Deadline:
KPFA invites members to run for a seat on the board during the nominations phase
(June 1st – July 14th). But states: "The deadline to file is June 30th, 2021."
Immediate action is required.

Info:
You can obtain the candidate nomination package here https://elections.pacifica.org/wordpress/candidate-nomination-package/.
As always, please feel free to contact us to find out additional details of the
position or ask any questions.

*Membership to KPFA is $25/year but the membership deadline for the current
voting year has passed.
