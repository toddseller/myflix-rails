PEACE AND JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS CALL FOR FREEDOM FOR JULIAN ASSANGE

Please add your name to the statement below in support of Julian Assange and
spread it widely to your email lists and through social media. The statement was
initiated by UNAC and initially signed by the bulk of peace organizations in the
US. The attack on Julian Assange is an attack on freedom of the press, freedom
of speech and an attack on all of us.

Imprisoned Wikileaks founder, journalist and free speech champion Julian Assange
today faces life imprisonment for telling the truth about U.S. war crimes in Iraq,
Afghanistan and at the U.S. torture base in Guantanamo Bay.

Assange faces charges under the 1917 U.S. Espionage Act. Prosecution under that
WWI anti-democratic law placed thousands of antiwar activists in prison for
exercising their free speech right to protest WWI.

Ironically, the Dec 19, 2021 New York Times front-page two-part series entitled,
Hidden Pentagon Records Reveal Patterns of Failure in Deadly Airstrikes, follows
in Assange’s footsteps in reporting U.S. war crimes, yet The Times staff writers
remain free.

Some 100 Times reporters evaluated Pentagon confidential documents obtained under
the Freedom of Information Act. These included reports on 50,000 U.S. airstrikes
on Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan conducted under the Obama and Trump administrations.
The Times on-the-scene reporters subsequently confirmed tens of thousands of
civilian casualties – collateral damage.

“The [Pentagon] documents,” according to The Times, “identify children killed or
injured in 27 percent of cases; in The Times’s ground-breaking reporting it was
62 percent.”

The Times and several other major publications worldwide reprinted much of the
same Pentagon material that Assange’s Wikileaks released to the world. Yet Assange
faces a life in prison for publishing the truth.

The persecution of Julian Assange by the U.S. government is a threat against free
speech and free press. It is also a threat to the Peace Movement and all movements
for social change since without information and the ability to speak and write
freely about U.S. wars and war crimes we are greatly limited, and the people of
the world are kept in the dark.

Therefore, Peace and Justice organizations and activists demand:

 • Free Julian Assange!
 • No to U.S. wars!
 • Freedom of the press!
 • Free journalists!
 • Free speech!

WHAT THINGS GO VIRAL?
(A MESSAGE FROM MARCIA EVERETT)

In recent times I can remember, Yellow vests, umbrella protests, Pink Pussy hats,
Let's Go Brandon chants. I remember "Je Suis Charlie" and everyone holding a
pencil, when the Charlie Hebdoe building was bombed. I remember the ice bucket
challenge and the #MeToo slogan.

Despite the media's corruption with capitalist benefactors, viral visual acts
make the TV news, because the medium, demands spectacle.

For 5 months I have been wearing white hair. Because Julian Assange has always
had white hair. Because Being informed is wisdom and WikiLeaks was informing us,
wisdom is represented with white hair.

The spectacle we need is for our leaders to never have a moment's peace from
Julian's White hair. We need everyone to don a white wig and keep it on. Until
he's free. Frankly, until all the whistleblowers are free and have their charges
dropped.

We have podcasters who have access to a lot of the population. If you ask your
supporters to do this and then ask the podcasters to do this, we could make a
spectacle that could force them to let him go.

Become a White Wig Warrior for Whistleblowers today by taking a photo of yourself
wearing a white wig and post it to social media using the hashtag WWW4W!
