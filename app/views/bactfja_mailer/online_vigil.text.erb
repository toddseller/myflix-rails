REPORT BACK: ♥️SOLIDARITY ACTION FOR JULIAN ASSANGE: STANDING WITH JULIAN: NO EXTRADITION!
Friday, December 10, 2021, British Embassy, San Francisco

by Toby Blomé

It was a very sad morning for so many of us around the world yesterday, as we
awoke to the horrendous news that a British high court overturned an earlier
court ruling, and increased the possibility for the extradition of journalist
and Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange to the U.S. This court ruling will be
appealed by Julian’s legal team, and there are also other aspects of the case
that still need to be ruled on, however, for those of us who hold Julian Assange
dear to our hearts, as a brother who risked and sacrificed so much for all of us
by exposing the injustices and war crimes of the U.S., we were heart-struck.

In just a matter of a few hours we managed to put together an "impromptu action”
at 3pm outside the British Embassy in San FrancIsco yesterday, with a banner, a
couple of signs, and seven Assange supporters. We stood for over an hour outside
the embassy, periodically expressing our outrage and declaring our demands through
a megaphone: “NO EXTRADITION” "FREE JULIAN ASSANGE” “DEFEND FREE PRESS & DEMOCRACY,”
“SHAME ON BRITAIN AND THE U.S." etc.

Thank you Adrienne Fong for bringing chalk and leaving behind an expression of
our intentions and demands on the sidewalk, including: "FREE JULIAN ASSANGE.”
(See attached photos)

We were pleased with the overwhelming support we received from many of the
passersby. Half a block away, one bicyclist shouted out "FREE JULIAN,” as he
whizzed by. At the end of our rally, we attempted to go inside the building to
the lobby, to see if someone would convey our demands to UK Embassy officials
located up on a “secure” floor. We were confident that we represented thousands
of people around the world, likely millions, who stand with Julian. But the
security guard locked the glass doors as we approached, so we couldn’t enter the
lobby. A short while later, however, another relatively friendly security guard
came outside and reported that he had already let the embassy staff know that we
were there, and what we were there for. When asked what he reported to them, he
was able to verbalize our key demands/purposes. (Probably from hearing them
expressed thru the megaphone earlier.) We all felt that our effort and time was
well spent!

Huge thanks to Diana, Fred, Bob, Adrienne, Lindsay and Ms.Perkin (a new friend
from Walnut Creek) who made themselves available on such short notice. WE THE
PEOPLE DEMAND JUSTICE FOR JULIAN!

STELLA MORIS STATEMENT ON JULIAN ASSANGE’S SUPREME COURT APPEAL

December 23, 2021 — This morning at 11:05 Julian Assange filed an application
for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court the High Court’s ruling that he can be
extradited to the US on three grounds.

The High Court’s ruling in USA v Assange raises three points of law of general
public importance that have an impact on the procedural and human rights
safeguards of a wide range of other types of cases.

On December 10th, the High Court upheld the Magistrates’ Court’s assessment,
based on the evidence before her, that there was a real risk that, should Julian
Assange be extradited to the United States, he would be subjected to near total
isolation, including under the regimes of SAMs (Special Administrative Measures)
and/or ADX, (administrative maximum prison) and that such isolation would cause
his mental condition to deteriorate to such a degree that there was a high risk
of suicide. These findings led the lower court to block the extradition under
s. 91 of the Extradition Act, which bans “oppressive” extraditions.

However, the High Court overturned the lower court’s decision to block the
extradition, based solely on the fact that after the US lost the extradition
case on January 4th 2021, the US State Department sent a letter to the UK Foreign
Office containing conditional assurances in relation to Julian Assange’s
placement under SAMs and ADX. The assurances letter explicitly states in points
one and four that “the United States retains the power” to “impose SAMs” on
Mr. Assange and to “designate Mr. Assange to ADX” should he say or do anything
since January 4, 2021 that would cause the US government to determine, in its
subjective assessment, that Julian Assange should be placed under SAMs conditions
and/or in ADX Florence. These conditional assurances alone were considered
sufficient by the High Court to overturn the lower court’s decision.

Under English law, in order for the application to have a chance to be considered
by the Supreme Court, first the same High Court judges who ordered Julian
Assange’s extradition must certify that at least one of the Supreme Court appeal
grounds is a point of law of general public importance
(s.114 of the 2003 Extradition Act).

Julian Assange’s application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court is
therefore currently under consideration by the High Court judges. It is not known
how long it will take for the decision to come down, but it is not expected
before the third week of January.

For background, see Julian Assange’s filing opposing the US extradition in the
High Court.
