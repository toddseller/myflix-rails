The Prosecution of Julian Assange and the Fight for Free Speech
Join us for an online panel discussion of leading attorneys, human rights defenders and social justice activists as the
London trial of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is underway. If Assange is extradited to the United States, he faces the
first-ever charges under the Espionage Act of 1917 for the publication of truthful information in the public interest.
Speakers will present the critical legal and policy issues involved as well as rebut government efforts to undermine the
reputation and credibility of Assange. In these difficult times for civil liberties and democratic rights we demand:
Free Julian Assange! Defend Free Speech and the First Amendment!
