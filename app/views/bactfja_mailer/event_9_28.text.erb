Solidarity Actions 4 Julian & Chelsea
Join us in Solidarity with #FreeAssange supporters around the globe!
@WiseUpAction @JA_Defence have monthly protests in support of Julian Assange. We will join them in solidarity as they
return to Belmarsh Prison after almost six months. We mark the end of Julian’s prison sentence for violating bail conditions
whilst seeking political asylum to protect his life and work from US persecution.
Sadly despite having served a most unfair sentence, Julian Assange will remain an inmate of Belmarsh in remand, awaiting
his Court hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court in February 2020 for the US Extradition Request. We protest against his
unfair imprisonment and demand he is not extradited. Join our action!
