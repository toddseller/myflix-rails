NOW IS A CRITICAL TIME TO STAND FOR JULIAN ASSANGE.
On November 23, 2020 Stella Moris, Julian’s fiancé, tweeted that over 70% of prisoners in Julian’s Belmarsh Prison wing
were infected with COVID-19. His life is in imminent danger and depends on us acting urgently!

In October, Tulsi Gabbard and Thomas Massie introduced House Resolution 1175, a bill calling for the United States to
ensure the release of Julian Assange. She introduced a similar bill, House Resolution 1162, with Matt Gaetz aimed at
dropping criminal charges against Edward Snowden. With Tulsi Gabbard leaving Congress it is imperative to ensure that
H.Res 1175 and H.Res. 1162 do not die with the start of the 117th Congress.

Please join us LIVE, if you can, at Representative Barbara Lee’s Congressional Office and stand for Julian Assange in
peaceful protest and educating the public with fliers and information.

Please bring signs/banners/fliers if you have them, but mainly just show up. Safe distancing & masks please.

If you cannot join us in Oakland, please consider joining us in solidarity at your local Representative’s office. Don’t
forget to send word/pictures of how it went!
