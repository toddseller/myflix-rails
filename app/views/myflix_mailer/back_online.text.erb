We're Back Baby!

Hi <%= @first_name %>,

We wanted to inform you that all services have been fully restored! Our
engineering team worked tirelessly to resolve this issue and get Myflix back
online. Although we regret any inconvenience this outage may have caused, we
truly believe that you should be living your life and not just watching Myflix.

We'd like to reassure you that this issue won't happen again, but we can't.
Let's be honest, we are too old and just don't care.

To say we are sorry, we'd like to let you know that we are going to offer you a
free months worth of Myflix. So hopefully this will stop all of your whinning
about it being down this weekend.

â€“The Myflix Team
