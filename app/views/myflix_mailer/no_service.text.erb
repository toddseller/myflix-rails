Important Service Notice

Hi <%= @first_name %>,

We wanted to inform you of a temporary interruption with your Myflix service.
Our engineers are currently upgrading the system to ensure continued service now
and into the future.

The service interruption will take place on Saturday, November 27th and should
only take an hour. If it isn't back online, please feel free to go pay for
another service. There are a lot of people who would love to have your access to
Myflix.

To be honest, if this is even causing an interruption for you then you should
probably have a job and not just be sitting at home watching Myflix. Honestly
why are you even reading this email? You should be on some job board, or God
forbid LinkedIn, looking for a job.
